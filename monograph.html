    <h1>Young Brides, Old Treasures</h1>
    <p>Published jointly by the Macedonian Arts Council and the Museum of International Folk Art, this truly beautiful monograph documents Macedonian folk art though five articles on topics ranging from embroidery and weaving techniques to the social significance of the costumes creation. In addition, the 170 pages of full scale photographs of the permanent Collection of Macedonian Folk Dress on display at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico through January 6, 2013 testify to the creative genius of the Macedonian embroideresses, keepers of Macedonian cultural identity.</p>
